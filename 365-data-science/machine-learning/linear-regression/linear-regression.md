# LINEAR REGRESSION

highlights a causal effect, one leads to the other.

A relationship  between two or more variables

## PROCESS

1. Get the sample data
2. Design a model that works for that sample
3. make a prediction for the whole population.

## independent and dependent variables

there are dependent and independent variables.

dependent variables are the ones being predicted and the independent variables are the ones that are used to predict.

the dependent variable is a function of the independent variables.

## SIMPLE LINEAR REGRESSION

y = B0 + B1X1 + e where:

y = dependent variable - the one we are trying to predict.
B0 = this is the value of y when x=0, the y-intercept
B1 = regression co-efficient - how much we expect y to change as we increase x, it quantifies the effect the education has on income.
X1 = independent variable
e = error of estimate, how much variation there is in our estimate of the regression coefficient. this is the difference between the actual income earned and the one predicted by the linear regression model.

## regression line

best fitting line through the data points.
